            This application primarily offers the possibility to convert a text input in various formats into an audio file. Afterwards, this file can be downloaded at the click of a button. In addition, two different parameters can be transferred during the input, namely the language and a speaker (male/female, different voice pitches) suitable for this. Secondary a translation function was implemented. Input and output language are selected, whereby the input language can also be recognized. The translation can additionally be converted into an audio file afterwards. <LineBreak/>
            This application was developed in the context of a school project by Priller Patrick, Huber Michael and Pastore Alex, whereby it concerns the 1st version.
